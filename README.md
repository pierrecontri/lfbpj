Little Framework Based on Php and Javascript

## Presentation

I developped my own MVC framework based on PHP. This framework is very simple. PHP is so ritch that we didn't need many tools. I just packaged many php functions into my owns functions for listing many files in directory, printing in TABLE or DIV some elements like mp3, jpg, pdf files.
The documentation about this framework is not finish due to no many time. I think this framework will be completely finished on the new year
If you would like to use it, please, send me a mail, I'll send you the zip file with all comments.

## Using

Actually, I only need 10 minutes for adding a complete category in my site.

Many time preparing, but now, I savor the simplicity for used my site.

## Documentation

I wrote a book for the complete documentation. You can found it on my personnal web site.
